# The AAA Pattern :
1.Arrange --> Define the testing environment & values
2.Act --> Run the acual code | functions that should be tested
3.Assert --> Evaluate the produced value result and compare it with expected value


# What should & shouldn't be tested
- Only test your code
- Don't test third-party code like "Browser api, native node module code, etc.."

# Writing a goof tests
- Follow AAA pattern
- Your test should only one unit or behavior

# The Diffs between toBe() and toEquals()
- toBe() should pathed value equal to expected value, so if the pathed value is object it will fails because the refrence in objects
- toEquals() will make a deep comparison

# We uses Spies & Mocks
- To dealing with side effects & External Dependencies
Spies => Wrappers around functions or empty replacements for functions that allow you track if & how a function was called 
Mocks => A replacement for an API that may provide some test-specific behavior instead
