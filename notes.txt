# The AAA Pattern :
1.Arrange --> Define the testing environment & values
2.Act --> Run the acual code | functions that should be tested
3.Assert --> Evaluate the produced value result and compare it with expected value


# What should & shouldn't be tested
- Only test your code
- Don't test third-party code like "Browser api, native node module code, etc.."

# Writing a goof tests
- Follow AAA pattern
- Your test should only one unit or behavior
